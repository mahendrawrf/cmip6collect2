    "title": "Incorrect data: nppLeaf, nppWood, and nppRoot",
    "description": "In our model, the (annual) NPP allocation is carried out on the last day of the year (our NPP allocation largely follows Sitch et al. [2003, Global Change Biology, 9, 161-185]). The error is due to the time averaging process in making the monthly data. But, the ratio between nppLeaf, nppWood and nppRoot is correct. Therefore, please correct as follows: nppLeaf (correct) = npp * nppLeaf / (nppLeaf + nppWood + nppRoot), nppWood (correct) = npp * nppWood / (nppLeaf + nppWood + nppRoot), and nppRoot (correct) = npp * nppRoot / (nppLeaf + nppWood + nppRoot). Note that these variables are derived on an annual basis. The same issue has occurred with MRI-ESM1 (our CMIP5 model).\nUpdate: New versions of all these variables have been published with the issue resolved.",
