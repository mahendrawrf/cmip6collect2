    "description": "Some CM4 and ESM4 snc output was incorrectly calculated. During processing, snc reported as a fraction of land area was re-normalized to the Data Request-specified fraction of grid cell area (by multiplying by land area fraction). Some CM4 snc datasets missed this processing step and so are were normalized properly. On the other hand, some ESM4 output was normalized twice, also resulting in incorrect data. Affected data will be withdrawn and republished.",
