    "title": "CO2 values are incorrect due to missing scaling factor",
    "description": "As part of the unit conversion from CESM output to CMIP output a scaling factor was never applied to the co2 variable resulting in incorrect values. The original units were kg CO2 / kg dry air, and as part of the conversion to mol / mol the data should have been multiplied by the ratio of the molecular weight of dry air to the molecular weight of CO2 (28.966/44.0).",
