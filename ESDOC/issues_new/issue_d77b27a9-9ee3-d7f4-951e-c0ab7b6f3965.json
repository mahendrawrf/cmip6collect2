    "description": "Due to a minor mismatch in some of the configuration files for HadGEM3-GC31-HH there are around 50 points, on the coastline, where the sea ice mass and thickness can grow to excessive values above 100,000 kg/m2, while neighbouring grid cells remain around 1-2,000 kg/m2. Instructions will be made available on how to mask these points.",
