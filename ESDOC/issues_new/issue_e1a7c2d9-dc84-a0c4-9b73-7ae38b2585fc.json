    "description": "Members 101 to 300 of the CESM1-WACCM-SC simulation pdSST-piArcSIC include a different treatment of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). It is not prescribed, unlike in members 1-100. This results in a different model mean climatology in these members, which makes interpretation of this experiment difficult. The corrected members 101-300 include a prescription of the QBO, similar to members 1-100.",
