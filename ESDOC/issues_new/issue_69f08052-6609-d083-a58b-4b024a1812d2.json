    "description": "The GISS piClim-hist ERF simulations were run with observed 1950 sea surface temperature and sea ice, contrary to the RFMIP-ERF experimental protocol.  We are re-running the simulations using the requested protocol where SST and sea ice are prescribed from a 30-year climatology of the corresponding piControl run.",
