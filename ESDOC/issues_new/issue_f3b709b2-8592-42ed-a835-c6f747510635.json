    "title": "Mean instead of instantaneous data submitted for Eyr_fracLut",
    "description": "For a number of simulations, the variable Eyr_fracLut mistakenly has been submitted as mean instead of instantaneous data. The affected datasets will be retracted. Except for the simulation years 2630-2849 of the MPI-ESM-1-2-HAM piControl_r1i1p1f1 simulation, it is not planned to publish corrected versions. For the affected simulations, the january monthly mean values of the variable Emon_fracLut can be an alternative.",
