    "description": "The surface downward CO2 flux (fgco2) is expressed by the mass of carbon dioxide, not carbon.(The unit of fgco2 uploaded is in kgCO2 m-2 s-1.) To express the flux as the mass of carbon (in kgC m-2 s-1), multiply the data by (12/44). The wrong data file will be withdrawn, and the corrected data file will be re-provided later.",
