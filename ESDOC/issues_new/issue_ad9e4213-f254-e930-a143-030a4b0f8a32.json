    "description": "Update: The historical experiment was mistakenly used to store output from both historical and historical-ext experiment. This has been corrected in v20200724 and historical and historical-ext are now used accordingly. \n\nNorCPM1\u2019s output has been specifically prepared to contribute to the DCPP MIP. The extension of the historical experiment beyond 2014 uses SSP2-4.5 scenario forcing and is intended to serve as a reference for the decadal prediction experiment dcppA-hindcast and assimilation experiment dcppA-assim. Acknowledging that applications may have issues with files containing data beyond the official historical period, we aggregated the cmor-ized historical output into the time chunks 1850-2014, 2015-2018 and 2019-2029. We advise users to regard the last two as unofficial and to ignore them if not intended as baseline for dcppA-hindcast/dcppA-assim.",
