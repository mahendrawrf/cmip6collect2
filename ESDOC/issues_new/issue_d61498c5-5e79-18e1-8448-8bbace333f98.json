    "description": "There are some undershoots in the salinity fields. These occur at some occasions in small bays of the Baltic. Apparently, they occur, when there are strong changes in sea-ice distribution. In the model, there is no explicit cut-off for salinity at 0. While these single values are surely unrealistic, the salinity fields are OK in the global view.",
