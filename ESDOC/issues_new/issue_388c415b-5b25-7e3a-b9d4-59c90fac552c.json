    "description": "Information on parent simulation should not have been given and as variant_info should have been written: \"AWI/MPI atmosphere-only PAMIP simulations are not branched off from AMIP simulations but initialized on the 1st of April, 2000 with ECMWF reanalysis data. For the spin-up period April and May 2000, the horizontal diffusion coefficients of the top model layers were modulated by factors of 1, 1.00001, 1.00002, and so forth until 1.00099 for r1i1p1f1, r2i1p1f1, r3i1p1f1, ..., r100i1p1f1. Since the atmosphere generally has a memory of around 2 weeks and since the first two months of PAMIP simulations are regarded as spin-up, AWI/MPI atmosphere-only simulations can still be compared with PAMIP simulations performed with other models. However, in AWI/MPI atmosphere-only simulations the QBO will be for all ensemble members in the same phase - in this case in a neutral phase - at initialization which is not the case for other models.\"",
